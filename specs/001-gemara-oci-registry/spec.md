# Feature Specification: Gemara OCI Content Delivery Registry

**Feature Branch**: `001-gemara-oci-registry`  
**Created**: 2026-02-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add a Gemara content delivery API implemented as an OCI Distribution Spec v2 server. Clients can discover and download Gemara compliance YAML (L1 guidance, L2 catalog, L3 policy) as OCI artifacts. Read-only: handshake GET /v2/, list repos GET /v2/_catalog, list tags GET /v2/{repo}/tags/list, get manifest GET /v2/{repo}/manifests/{reference}, get blob GET /v2/{repo}/blobs/{digest}. Storage: blobs on filesystem (content-addressable by sha256), tag/digest index in embedded BBolt. Return 404 with OCI-style JSON errors when tag or digest is missing. No auth in this phase. Support Gemara media types in manifests (guidance, catalog, policy). Align with existing complybeacon-api.yaml OCI paths where defined."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Discover Available Gemara Content (Priority: P1)

A compliance tool operator wants to see what Gemara content is available in the
registry so they can decide which policies, catalogs, or guidance to download.

**Why this priority**: Discovery is the entry point. Without knowing what exists,
no other interaction is useful.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making HTTP requests to the handshake and
catalog endpoints and verifying the response lists known repositories.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the registry is running with pre-loaded content, **When** a client
   sends `GET /v2/`, **Then** the server returns `200 OK` with header
   `Docker-Distribution-API-Version: registry/2.0`.
2. **Given** the registry contains repositories (e.g. `policies/rhel11`,
   `catalogs/pci-dss`, `guidance/nist`), **When** a client sends
   `GET /v2/_catalog`, **Then** the server returns a JSON object with a
   `repositories` array listing all repository names.
3. **Given** a repository `policies/rhel11` has tags `v1.0.0` and `v1.1.0`,
   **When** a client sends `GET /v2/policies/rhel11/tags/list`, **Then** the
   server returns `{"name": "policies/rhel11", "tags": ["v1.0.0", "v1.1.0"]}`.

### User Story 2 - Download a Specific Version of Gemara Content (Priority: P1)

A compliance tool (or human operator using curl/oras) wants to download a
specific version of a Gemara artifact (e.g. an L2 catalog at tag `v1.0.0`) so
they can use it locally for policy evaluation.

**Why this priority**: Downloading content is the core value of the registry. It
is co-equal with discovery.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting a manifest by tag, extracting
the blob digest from the manifest layers, then fetching the blob and verifying
it matches the expected YAML content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** repository `catalogs/osps-b` has tag `v1.0.0`, **When** a client
   sends `GET /v2/catalogs/osps-b/manifests/v1.0.0`, **Then** the server
   returns the OCI manifest JSON with `Content-Type:
   application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json` and a `Docker-Content-Digest`
   header containing the manifest digest.
2. **Given** a manifest layer descriptor has digest `sha256:abc123...` and media
   type `application/vnd.gemara.catalog.v1+yaml`, **When** a client sends
   `GET /v2/catalogs/osps-b/blobs/sha256:abc123...`, **Then** the server
   streams the raw YAML file with `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`.
3. **Given** repository `catalogs/osps-b` has a manifest stored by digest,
   **When** a client sends
   `GET /v2/catalogs/osps-b/manifests/sha256:<digest>`, **Then** the server
   returns the same manifest as when fetched by tag.

---

### User Story 3 - Handle Missing Content Gracefully (Priority: P2)

A client requests a repository, tag, or blob that does not exist. The registry
must return a clear, OCI-compliant error so the client can handle it
programmatically.

**Why this priority**: Robust error handling is essential for any registry
client, but it depends on the core read path (US1/US2) being implemented first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting non-existent repositories,
tags, and digests and verifying the error response format and HTTP status code.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no repository named `policies/nonexistent` exists, **When** a
   client sends `GET /v2/policies/nonexistent/tags/list`, **Then** the server
   returns `404` with JSON body
   `{"errors": [{"code": "NAME_UNKNOWN", "message": "..."}]}`.
2. **Given** repository `policies/rhel11` exists but has no tag `v99.0.0`,
   **When** a client sends
   `GET /v2/policies/rhel11/manifests/v99.0.0`, **Then** the server returns
   `404` with `{"errors": [{"code": "MANIFEST_UNKNOWN", "message": "..."}]}`.
3. **Given** no blob with digest `sha256:0000...` exists, **When** a client
   sends `GET /v2/policies/rhel11/blobs/sha256:0000...`, **Then** the server
   returns `404` with `{"errors": [{"code": "BLOB_UNKNOWN", "message": "..."}]}`.

---

### User Story 4 - Gemara Media Types in Manifests (Priority: P2)

A compliance tool needs to distinguish between Gemara content types (L1 guidance,
L2 catalog, L3 policy) within a manifest so it can handle each layer
appropriately.

**Why this priority**: Media type differentiation is important for correct client
behavior, but the registry can serve content without it being validated on the
client side.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by fetching a manifest and inspecting the
`mediaType` field of each layer descriptor.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a manifest for an L3 policy artifact, **When** a client fetches the
   manifest, **Then** the layer descriptor's `mediaType` is
   `application/vnd.gemara.policy.v1+yaml`.
2. **Given** a manifest for an L2 catalog artifact, **When** a client fetches the
   manifest, **Then** the layer descriptor's `mediaType` is
   `application/vnd.gemara.catalog.v1+yaml`.
3. **Given** a manifest for an L1 guidance artifact, **When** a client fetches the
   manifest, **Then** the layer descriptor's `mediaType` is
   `application/vnd.gemara.guidance.v1+yaml`.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the blob storage directory does not exist or is empty at
  startup? The server should start successfully and return empty catalog/tag
  lists until content is loaded.
- What happens when a BBolt database file does not exist at startup? The server
  should create a new, empty database.
- What happens when a manifest references a blob digest that is missing from the
  filesystem? The server should return `404 BLOB_UNKNOWN` for blob requests even
  if the manifest exists.
- What happens when two requests arrive simultaneously for different tags? The
  server must handle concurrent reads safely (BBolt read transactions are
  parallel-safe).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST implement the OCI Distribution Spec v2 handshake at
  `GET /v2/`, returning `200 OK` with header
  `Docker-Distribution-API-Version: registry/2.0`.
- **FR-002**: System MUST list all repository names via `GET /v2/_catalog`,
  derived from the tags stored in the index.
- **FR-003**: System MUST list all tags for a given repository via
  `GET /v2/{name}/tags/list`, returning the repository name and tag array.
- **FR-004**: System MUST return an OCI manifest via
  `GET /v2/{name}/manifests/{reference}`, supporting both tag and digest as
  reference. When reference is a tag, the system looks up the digest in the
  index; when reference is a digest, the system looks up the manifest directly.
- **FR-005**: System MUST stream a raw blob via
  `GET /v2/{name}/blobs/{digest}`, reading from the content-addressable
  filesystem store.
- **FR-006**: System MUST store blobs on the filesystem in a content-addressable
  layout: `{storage_root}/blobs/sha256/{prefix}/{full_hex}`, where `{prefix}` is
  the first two hex characters of the digest.
- **FR-007**: System MUST use an embedded BBolt database as the metadata index,
  with a `tags` bucket (key: `{repo}:{tag}`, value: digest string) and a
  `manifests` bucket (key: digest string, value: OCI manifest JSON).
- **FR-008**: System MUST use BBolt read transactions (`db.View`) for all read
  operations to ensure parallel safety.
- **FR-009**: System MUST return OCI-compliant JSON error bodies for 404
  responses, using codes `NAME_UNKNOWN`, `MANIFEST_UNKNOWN`, and `BLOB_UNKNOWN`.
- **FR-010**: System MUST set `Content-Type:
  application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json` and
  `Docker-Content-Digest: {digest}` headers on manifest responses.
- **FR-011**: System MUST set `Content-Type: application/octet-stream` on blob
  responses.
- **FR-012**: Manifests MUST support Gemara-specific media types in layer
  descriptors: `application/vnd.gemara.policy.v1+yaml` (L3),
  `application/vnd.gemara.catalog.v1+yaml` (L2), and
  `application/vnd.gemara.guidance.v1+yaml` (L1).
- **FR-013**: System MUST NOT require authentication for any endpoint in this
  phase.
- **FR-014**: The storage root path MUST be configurable (e.g. via environment
  variable or command-line flag).

### Key Entities

- **Repository**: A named collection of tagged artifacts (e.g.
  `policies/rhel11`, `catalogs/osps-b`). Repositories have a name (string, may
  contain slashes) and zero or more tags.
- **Tag**: A human-readable version label (e.g. `v1.0.0`, `latest`) pointing to
  a specific manifest digest within a repository.
- **Manifest**: An OCI image manifest (JSON) describing one or more layers. Each
  layer has a digest, size, and media type. The manifest also has a config
  descriptor.
- **Blob**: A content-addressable file on disk, identified by its sha256 digest.
  Blobs contain the raw Gemara YAML content.
- **Index (BBolt)**: An embedded key-value database mapping tags to digests
  (`tags` bucket) and digests to manifest JSON (`manifests` bucket).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A client using standard OCI tooling (e.g. `oras`, `crane`, `curl`)
  can discover all available Gemara content in under 2 seconds for a registry
  with up to 100 repositories.
- **SC-002**: A client can download a specific Gemara YAML artifact (manifest +
  blob) in a single request flow (manifest then blob) without errors.
- **SC-003**: All 404 error responses conform to the OCI error format and include
  the correct error code, verifiable by automated tests.
- **SC-004**: Concurrent read requests (at least 10 simultaneous) complete
  without data corruption or server errors.
- **SC-005**: The registry starts successfully with an empty storage directory and
  returns empty catalog/tag lists, verifiable by an integration test.

## Assumptions

- The registry is **read-only** in this phase; content is pre-loaded to disk and
  BBolt by an external process (e.g. a CLI tool or script). Push (write) support
  is out of scope.
- **No pagination** is needed for catalog or tag listing in this phase;
  registries are expected to have a small number of repositories and tags.
- **No HEAD** requests are needed in this phase; GET-only is sufficient.
- Each manifest contains a **single layer** pointing to one Gemara YAML blob.
  Multi-layer manifests are out of scope for this phase.
- The OCI manifest **config** descriptor will use a minimal empty config blob
  (or `application/vnd.oci.empty.v1+json`); no Gemara-specific config metadata
  is needed in this phase.
- The OCI routes will be served by the **existing Compass Gin server** (same
  binary, same port), alongside the existing `POST /v1/enrich` endpoint.
- The OpenAPI spec file `complybeacon-api.yaml` already has placeholder OCI paths;
  the implementation will align with and complete those definitions.
